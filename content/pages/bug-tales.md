      Welcome to Bug Tales - a collection of debugging stories, mysterious bugs, and the journey to solve them.
      
      
      Every developer has war stories about bugs that took days to find, edge cases that broke everything, 
      and those "impossible" issues that turned out to have the simplest solutions.
      
      
      Here I share some of the most interesting bugs I've encountered, the investigation process, 
      and the lessons learned along the way.
      
      
      ### Featured Bug Tales
      
      - **The Case of the Disappearing Data**: A race condition that only occurred on Tuesdays
      - **Memory Leak Mystery**: How a single forgotten event listener brought down production
      - **The Unicode Nightmare**: When emoji broke our entire search functionality
      - **Async Await Confusion**: The Promise that never resolved (and why)
