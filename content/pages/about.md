##### Shravan is a Jr Software Developer, loves exploring, traveling, and reading books. A keen and curious human when it comes to technology and different human aspects of life.&#xA;&#xA;He is such a tireless seeker of knowledge. He loves to learn new things and explore them and by nature a practical learner. You best describe him as spiritual learning generalist with passion towards excellence.

That's enough of talking about myself in the third person.

As you already know, I am Shravan Kumar B, you can call me SK. Apart from that general information, you also now know I love traveling, reading books and that I am a keen learner.

After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I started my journey in a startup, doing what I love, i.e., building products and solving problems. I have worked on a couple of technologies, I am looking forward to exploring more. I contribute to open source and love the Open Source Community.
