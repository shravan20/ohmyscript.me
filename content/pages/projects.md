  - title: Autonomous Garbage Collecting System using Internet of Things
    section_id: lorem-ipsum
    image_alt: lorem-ipsum
    content: >
      This project aimed at designing a Garbage Collection System using a Robot
      in the Indoors based on Indoor Positioning System using Internet of
      Things. A smart bin was deployed which would notify the Collector Robot to
      collect the garbage as and when it was filled.


      A system consisting of a smart bin and an Autonomous Garbage Collecting
      Robot collects the garbage from the bin when the garbage threshold level
      is reached.

      Two major challenges were solved, firstly **Path Planning for the
      locomotion of the Robot** & **Autonomous Control of the Robot**.
